# Hi there, I'm @rdavidson1911! 

üí° Currently, I'm immersing myself in the cutting-edge realm of Machine Learning. Why, you ask? It's a field that intertwines the psychological, epistemological, and existential aspects of our world, which I find utterly fascinating. My interests have always been a medley of information technology, philosophy, mathematics, and psychology. Machine Learning manages to encapsulate all these fields in one, making it a thrilling journey!

üëÅÔ∏è I am starting to feel like Joquan Phoenix from that classic movie 'Her' where he falls in love with his operating system.  That is how I feel about CHATGPT.  
Last week, I prompt engineered her to keep me on the task at hand or my important weekly main mini-goal.....  

And then some shiny new thing crosses my conciousness when I go to check my email and find some interesting new AI or cryptocurrency news article and I ask 'Her' to summarize it for me. 
üò† She gets a really pissy tone ...... (blink blinky blinky) 

"We have to finish the app you wanted me to help you create.  What does this have to do with creating our app!", -CHATPGPT4 üòÜ

üå± I am beginning to reflect on what a really good frend and coworker (IT Manager) said to me (Corporate Controller) one day at work.  He told me I needed to take the Excel needle (I was addicted) out of my arm AND start using SQL to do my data mining.  That was many years ago and he was right!  I discovered that writing Python was built for not just science and mathematicians, it has power and ease of use that top SQL and Excel combined.  

ü™°I used to think command prompt in Windows was the most powerful, magical thing ever!  Then I learned to write automation using Linix bash shell and Windwows Powershell.  I am so glad that I know that I don't know and choose to keep an open mind and try new ways of doing life and doing work.  

üì´ Feel free to reach out to me: @rdavidson1911





## Current Projects 
---
TOP SECRET SOFTWARE PROJECT WITH A GOOD FRIEND
CREATING A OBSIDIAN KNOWLEDGE SOFTWARE PLUGIN USING THE ELECTRON / ATOM SOFTWARE FRAMEWORK
GOING THROUGH THE PYTHON BUILT-IN LIBRARIES LINE BY LINE - ALSO PANDAS LIBRARIES
CREATING 1-2 COLAB JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS PER DAY TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM AND KEEP LEARNING TO WORK SMARTER, NOT HARDER

üöÄ I've joined the Hugging Face Community to continue building my understanding of Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs). My hope is to eventually contribute to the advancement of humanity and propose applications that will benefit our wonderful world, Earth.  [UPDATE 8/3/23 - Still playing with open source data models, but do most of my playing in Google Colab Jupyter Python Notebooks

[COMPLETED] üî¨ I'm currently developing a Microsoft Excel workbook that creates a small-scale neural network. I hope this project will help others understand how LLMs work under the hood.
[COMPLETED] üíûÔ∏è My future goal? Collaborating to build my first Dapp. - Built 1 NFT using the 'Hardhat' framework
[COMPLETED]    Proficient working with the new Excel Lambdas functions and have crated soma prety amazing recursive functions that Excel does not offer natively and which made it so I didn't have to mess with the security issues of VBA and macros (although that was my f
[ONGOING_FOREVER] üëÄ I'm on a mission to dive deep into the world of Solidity and Ethereum, aiming to understand and interact with the underlying mechanics of the emerging web 3.0.
               'Love Language' and it will always be near and dear to me.

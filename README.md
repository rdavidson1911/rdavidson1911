👋 Hi there, I'm @rdavidson1911!

💡 Currently, I'm immersing myself in the cutting-edge realm of Machine Learning. Why, you ask? It's a field that intertwines the psychological, epistemological, and existential aspects of our world, which I find utterly fascinating. My interests have always been a medley of information technology, philosophy, mathematics, and psychology. Machine Learning manages to encapsulate all these fields in one, making it a thrilling journey!

👀 I'm on a mission to dive deep into the world of Solidity and Ethereum, aiming to understand and interact with the underlying mechanics of the emerging web 3.0.

🌱 For the time being, I'm taking a detour from exploring the vast landscape of various blockchains, Layer 1s and Layer 2s, and their intertwined ecosystems.

💞️ My future goal? Collaborating to build my first Dapp.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me: @rdavidson1911

## Current Projects 

🚀 I've joined the Hugging Face Community to continue building my understanding of Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs). My hope is to eventually contribute to the advancement of humanity and propose applications that will benefit our wonderful world, Earth.

🔬 I'm currently developing a Microsoft Excel workbook that creates a small-scale neural network. I hope this project will help others understand how LLMs work under the hood.
